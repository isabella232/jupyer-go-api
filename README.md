# jupyter-go-api

This is an **experimental** repository that contains a Jupyter API server built using [Go](https://golang.org/) and [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/). The goals are to learn Go, learn how to build and load test a production-grade API that can handle hundreds of QPS, and have some fun.
